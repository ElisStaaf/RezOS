# TODO
### Dynamic FAT
Currently the FAT has pre-determined size, which limits the maximum ammount of files on the system
### Indexed FLTs and BLTs
Currently a file can have only have 50 sub/super files.
### Filenaming constraints
Currently a filename can contain any ASCII character.
### Recursive input 
Currently directories can not be used as input
### Improve error handling
Pretty self explanatory
